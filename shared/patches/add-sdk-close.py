"""Add a Close() method to the fforchino vector-go-sdk.

The upstream SDK opens a gRPC connection to the robot in vector.New() but
never exposes a way to close it - *.Vector has no Close(). Every connection
therefore leaks until the robot's small SDK connection budget fills and it
stops responding (the "drops after a question or two" failure).

This patch keeps the underlying *grpc.ClientConn on the Vector struct and
adds a Close() method that releases it. The install scripts pull the pinned
SDK commit into chipper/third_party/vector-go-sdk and add a go.mod `replace`
directive; this script then patches that local copy. fix-connection-leak.py
adds the matching `defer robot.Close()` calls in Wire-Pod's kgsim.go.

Idempotent. Modifies pkg/vector/vector.go of the local SDK copy.
