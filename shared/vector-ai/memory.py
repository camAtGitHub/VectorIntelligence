"""Persistent memory for Vector. SQLite-backed, one row per durable fact.

Memories are durable facts about the user (names, preferences, ongoing
projects, things they've told Vector). Each is a single short string. The
LLM decides what to store via the {{remember||...}} command emitted in
its response; service.py captures and saves them here.

All memories are injected into the system prompt on every turn so the LLM
can refer to them. For a single-user companion bot, this scales fine into
the thousands of entries before context becomes a concern.
