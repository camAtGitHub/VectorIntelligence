"""Turn Vector to face the speaker before the LLM replies.

On every LLM-bound voice query (not just vision ones), dispatch
intent_imperative_lookatme via IntentPass BEFORE calling the LLM - Vector's
firmware uses his still-fresh sound-direction cache to rapid-turn toward
whoever just spoke. Skipped when he's on the charger, so he never drives
off his pod (vision queries get a brief pause so he faces the user before
describing the scene).

Dispatching the intent closes the chipper voice stream (IsFinal=true), but
StreamingKGSim's response goes through the SDK (robot.Conn.SayText), so the
LLM answer still reaches the user. StreamingKGSim's own
IntentPass(intent_greeting_hello) then fails silently on the closed
stream - harmless.

Requires ttr.IsOnCharger() - see add-sensor-reactions.py.

Modifies preqs/intent_graph.go. Idempotent.
