"""Add on-demand face detection to Wire-Pod's response interrupter.

Vector should know who he's talking to so memory can be scoped per face,
but subscribing to robot_observed_face 24/7 is a firehose - Vector emits a
face event on every frame, which overloads his firmware and degrades his
whole network stack over time.

This patch adds robot_observed_face to the interrupt loop's event whitelist
*only*. That stream opens per-response and closes when the response ends,
so face detection runs solely for the lifetime of a voice interaction -
never a continuous background stream.

Observed faces are reported to vector-ai via notifyFaceSeen (defined in
sensor_reactions.go by add-sensor-reactions.py), which rate-limits the calls.

Run after the other kgsim_interrupt.go patches (wake-word-grace-period,
add-button-interrupt, wake-word-mute-during-getimage) - its anchors are
chosen not to collide with theirs, but this keeps the ordering obvious.

Idempotent. Modifies chipper/pkg/wirepod/ttr/kgsim_interrupt.go.
