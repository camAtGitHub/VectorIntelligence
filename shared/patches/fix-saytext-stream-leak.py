"""Fix the BehaviorControl stream leak in Wire-Pod's sayText helper.

Upstream sayText (chipper/pkg/wirepod/ttr/bcontrol.go) opens a
BehaviorControl stream with context.Background() and never cancels it.
Sending ControlRelease ends the control reservation but NOT the stream -
the robot's vic-gateway keeps it open until the underlying gRPC connection
closes. Callers on short-lived connections get away with that; the sensor
reaction loop (add-sensor-reactions.py) calls sayText on a connection that
stays up for days, so every pickup/putdown/pet reaction permanently leaks
one server-side stream on the robot. Enough of them and vic-gateway stops
serving new requests: TCP still connects, new RPCs hang to deadline, Vector
shows the wifi-exclamation icon (issue #8's "works for a few commands then
dies" - and its background twin, wedging with no interaction at all).

Two further upstream bugs in the same function go with it:
  - the inner goroutine busy-waits on `select { default: continue }`,
    burning a CPU core for the whole utterance;
  - the outer goroutine ends with `for range start` on a channel nobody
    closes, so it blocks forever - one leaked goroutine per call, and on
    the no-grant path the leak happens before the robot even speaks.

The replacement does the acquire-speak-release cycle synchronously in one
goroutine under a 30s context that is cancelled on exit - the cancel is
what actually tears the stream down robot-side. No channels, no spin.

Idempotent. Modifies chipper/pkg/wirepod/ttr/bcontrol.go.
